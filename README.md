AnitaB.org has many volunteers that offer their skills, time, and commitment to
our vision and projects. The **Volunteer Management System** (VMS) will
be useful for volunteer coordinators, volunteer sign-up, tracking hours, and
reporting.

**This project is under active development (again).**

Features
--------

The VMS is developed in phases. The initial implementation tracks
volunteers' contact information, enables administrators to track volunteer
hours, and allows reporting of useful information.


Installation
------------

The VMS project uses the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) web
framework and [Python](https://www.python.org/).

To get started, read the [Installation Guide](aut_docs/Installation_Setup.md).


Run VMS in a Docker Container
-----------------------------

If you wish to view a sneak peek of the AnitaB.org VMS, you may use Docker to
preview the VMS.
Note: The following Docker configuration is not intended to be run in
production at the moment. It may be configured to do so in the future.

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/installation/).
   Follow the installation steps for your specific operating system:
     * Docker runs natively on a Linux-based system.
     * For Windows and Mac OS X, you should follow instructions for installing
       boot2docker which also installs VirtualBox.
1. Install [docker-compose](http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
   Note: fig has been deprecated. Docker-compose replaces fig.
1. Create a new directory on your local system.
1. Enter `git clone git@github.com:anitab-org/vms.git` to clone the AnitaB.org
   VMS repository. After the clone is done, change directory (cd) to the
   `vms` directory.
1. Run `docker-compose build`. This pulls the Docker images required to run the
   project and installs the necessary dependencies.
1. Run `docker run -e SECRET_KEY=foobarbaz vms_web`
1. Run `docker-compose run web python vms/manage.py migrate`.
1. Run `docker-compose run web python vms/manage.py cities_light` for downloading and importing data for django-cities-light.
1. *Optional:*
   Run `docker-compose run web python vms/manage.py createsuperuser`
   if you wish to create a superuser to access the admin panel.
1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the webserver for the Django AnitaB.org VMS
   project.
1. AnitaB.org VMS should be running on port 8000.
     * If you are on Linux, enter `http://0.0.0.0:8000` in your browser.
     * If you are using boot2docker on Windows or Mac OS X, enter
       `http://192.168.59.103:8000/` in your browser. If this IP address
       doesn't work, run `boot2docker ip` from the command line and replace
       the previous IP address in the HTTP request with the IP returned by
       boot2docker.
